## App Concepts

As a subsidiary eCommerce brand of the fictional airline ***Soarair***, ***Soarair Kids*** specialises in selling a range of kids' travel and aviation-related merchandise including:

- Kids Travel Accessories
- Kids Bags/ Luggage
- Models and Toys
- Flight Comforts
- Apparel/ Costume
- Back-to-school collection

An additional equivalent points are attached to each items beside the monetary pricing found on the landing page as well as product details page, just to illustrate the concept of an airline loyalty store. Although demonstrated on the product details, payment will not be implemented in this design as it is assumed that a user is a visitor without an associated account in the first place. On the landing page, the user can navigate through to the middle of the page or the dropdown categories menu on the navigation bar to visit any categories for their shopping.

## User Stories

| User Story    | Title    | Story    | Acceptance Criteria     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 1| View products by category | "As a user, I want to be able to view all of the products by category so that I can focus exclusively on the products that interest me and save time from searching through all items." |- Categories should be listed on the landing page and navigation bar.<br> - Search bar on the landing page that leads to a page of items belonging to a category. <br> - On each item page, a breadcrumb leads the user back to the category they were shopping in.|
| 2 | Search item by keyword |‚ÄúAs a user, I'd prefer the option to search for something because it saves me time from having to browse through all the categories and things that I am not looking for.‚Äù|- All pages will have a search field added to the navigation bar that returns products that contain the query terms in the title, description, or category of the item. <br> - Returns an error message if no results are found.|
| 3 | Select and View details of a product |"As a user, I want to see product details for a specific product so that I can ensure I understand all of the specifications before purchasing, allowing me to find a product that is suitable for my child‚Äôs age.‚Äù| - The product price (and equivalent loyalty points), colour, product images, product information and features, return and refund policy, ratings and reviews have to be displayed for user‚Äôs viewing. <br> - If no stock is available, the product should be marked "Out of Stock." <br> - The discounted price is displayed for items on sale. <br> - The age range the product is intended for should be visible.|
| 4 | Edit shopping basket |‚ÄúAs a user, I would like to be able to add items to the shopping cart to purchase with other items as well as edit the quantity or remove items I don‚Äôt want to include in my final purchase if I need to change my mind.‚Äù|- Allow user to add product of a specified quantity to the shopping cart on the product detail page. <br> - Single product can be removed from the shopping cart. <br> - Product quantity can be adjusted in the shopping cart. <br> - Shopping cart can be removed in its entirety, i.e. removing all items at once. <br> - Send a prompt to the screen when items are successfully removed.|
| 5 | View shopping basket content at any time |‚ÄúAs a user, I want the shopping cart status to be saved for later review so that I can continue shopping at any point.‚Äù|Shopping cart navigation to be provided on the navigation bar that leads user to the most recent shopping basket|
| 6 | Complete the order with personal details |"As a user, I'd like to be able to check out all items I have added to my shopping cart by providing my contact details so that I can enjoy a simple, user friendly online shopping experience with only a few clicks."|- Check out page to display the list of items, subtotal by product, and the total indicative price. <br> - Requests name, shipping address, phone number from the user at check out. <br> - Send a prompt to the user that the order has been successfully placed.|

## Conceptual Model

All users are assumed to purchase as visitors to simplify the conceptual model to one that only meets the user's minimal requirements. As a result, the user class can be removed, and customer details such as shipping address and name become attributes of an order provided by the customer upon order completion. A product instance has associated star ratings, as shown on the landing page and details page, as well as customer reviews, which, if implemented, should have their own class called `Reviews` and are stored in the product class as a list of reviews. However, this has been ignored as it is deemed out of the scope of the user requirements, and the number of ratings along with other attributes such as redemption dates to be displayed on the page are only served as additional information to the products to bring the design into a realistic fruition. Additionally, it is assumed in this model that a product can only belong to one and only one category.

Thoughts have been made over whether to include shopping cart as a separate class to store the temporary state of items. However, since both the cart and order contain a list of products and eventually a cart will turn into an order if proceeded to check out. Due to the similarities of functions, Order will act as a multifunctional class to serve as a shopping cart (i.e., an incomplete order) and a completed order with customer details with the order status differentiating if the order has been completed. The removal of shopping cart also removes the need of having an additional cartDetails table that instantiates the many-to-many relationship between cart and items.

## Database Design

The data model features an additional table - `orderDetails` table to establish a many-to-many relationship between the classes. Connections can now be made between specific orders and products and vice versa. Quantity and item total in points and dollar values are also stored in the same table to allow calculation of order sum at checkout, as a customer may order multiple items for one particular product.

## Installation and Execution Guide

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher

### Step 1: Install SQLite3
- Refer to installation guide: https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies in Virtual Environment

```bash
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy flask-bootstrap flask-wtf email_validator
```

### Step 3: Initialize the Database

Run the `create_db.py` in the project root with the following content:

```python
from soarair import create_app, db

app = create_app()
with app.app_context():
    db.create_all()
    print("Database tables created successfully!")
```

Run the script to create the database tables:
```bash
python init_db.py
```

### Step 4: Seed the Database (Using the built-in `/admin` route)

Start the application:
```bash
python run.py
```

Visit the following URL in your browser:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin/dbseed/
```

If the seeding process has worked then you should be greeted by `DATA LOADED` and now see `categories`, `orderdetails`, `orders` and `products` tables in the SQLite DB browser app.

### Step 5: Run the Application

```bash
python run.py
```

Access the application at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
